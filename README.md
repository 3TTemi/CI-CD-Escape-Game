# Level 3 — Merge Conflict Hell

You discovered an open pull request that conflicts with your current branch.

This is intentional.  
Welcome to merge-conflict land.

## Your Task
1. Attempt to merge the PR (your facilitator will point you to it)
2. Resolve the merge conflict in `src/add.js`
3. Commit the resolution  
4. Push your merge  

When CI turns **🟢 GREEN**, you escape Level 3.

## Hints
- Look for the conflict markers:  
  `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`
- Your final code must make sense *and* pass tests  
- Don’t delete half the file by accident 🤓
