# Level 2 — Your Tests Are Lying

Your CI workflow runs, but the tests immediately fail.

Either:
- the test is wrong  
- the code is wrong  
- or both  

## Your Task
Fix the failing test in `tests/add.test.js` or the implementation in `src/add.js` so that the test suite passes.

When the tests run **🟢 GREEN**, you escape Level 2.

## Hints
- Compare what the test *expects* vs what the function *does*
- Don’t overthink it — this is intentionally small

Onward! 🚀
